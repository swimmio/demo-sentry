# The main functionality of the Freight plugin

The Freight plugin provides a webhook configuration for Freight notifications. This allows Sentry to receive notifications from Freight about release tracking events.

```python
DOC_HTML = """
<p>Configure a Freight notification with the given webhook url.</p>
<pre class="clippy">{{
    "type": "sentry",
    "config": {{"webhook_url": "{hook_url}"}}
}}</pre>
"""
```
