# Understanding the current integration

The `PagerDutyIntegrationProvider` class is the main entry point for the PagerDuty integration. It defines the key features of the integration, such as alert rules and incident management.

```python
class PagerDutyIntegrationProvider(IntegrationProvider):
    key = "pagerduty"
    name = "PagerDuty"
    metadata = metadata
    features = frozenset([IntegrationFeatures.ALERT_RULE, IntegrationFeatures.INCIDENT_MANAGEMENT])
    integration_cls = PagerDutyIntegration
```

# Extending the integration

The `PagerDutyClient` class is where the actual API calls to PagerDuty are made. To extend the integration with more features, you would add more methods to this class that make the necessary API calls.

```python
class PagerDutyClient(ApiClient):
    allow_redirects = False
    integration_name = "pagerduty"
    base_url = "https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue"

    def __init__(self, integration_key):
        self.integration_key = integration_key
        super().__init__()

    def request(self, method, path, headers=None, data=None, params=None):
        if not headers:
            headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

        return self._request(method, path, headers=headers, data=data, params=params)

    def send_trigger(self, data):
        # expected payload: https://v2.developer.pagerduty.com/docs/send-an-event-events-api-v2
        if isinstance(data, Event):
            source = data.transaction or data.culprit or "<unknown>"
            group = data.group
            level = data.get_tag("level") or "error"
```
