# List of Endpoints

The list of endpoints for each entity is defined under the `paths` section in the `openapi.json` file. Each endpoint is associated with a specific operation like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

```json
  "paths": {
    "/api/0/organizations/{organization_slug}/teams/": {
      "$ref": "paths/teams/index.json"
    },
    "/api/0/teams/{organization_slug}/{team_slug}/": {

    },
    "/api/0/teams/{organization_slug}/{team_slug}/projects/": {
      "$ref": "paths/teams/projects.json"
