title: Getting started with Jira
---
Jira is a popular issue tracking and project management tool. In the context of the `demo-sentry` repository, Jira is integrated through the `JiraPlugin` class in `src/sentry_plugins/jira/plugin.py`. This plugin allows Sentry to interact with a Jira instance, enabling functionalities like creating and linking Sentry issue groups directly to a Jira ticket in any of your projects. The `JiraClient` class in `src/sentry_plugins/jira/client.py` is used to communicate with the Jira API, handling operations like fetching project metadata, creating issues, and searching for users. The `get_jira_client` function in `src/sentry_plugins/jira/plugin.py` is used to instantiate the `JiraClient` with the appropriate credentials.

# Jira Plugin in Sentry

This file defines the `JiraPlugin` class, which is responsible for the integration between Sentry and Jira. It includes methods for configuring the plugin, creating and linking Jira issues from Sentry, and building dynamic fields based on Jira's meta field information. The `get_group_urls` method defines the endpoints for the plugin.

```python
class JiraPlugin(CorePluginMixin, IssuePlugin2):
    description = "Integrate JIRA issues by linking a project."
    slug = "jira"
    title = "JIRA"
    conf_title = title
    conf_key = slug
    required_field = "username"
    feature_descriptions = [
        FeatureDescription(
            """
            Create and link Sentry issue groups directly to a Jira ticket in any of your
            projects, providing a quick way to jump from a Sentry bug to tracked ticket!
            """,
            IntegrationFeatures.ISSUE_BASIC,
        )
    ]

    def get_group_urls(self):
        _patterns = super().get_group_urls()
        _patterns.append(
            url(

# Jira API Client

This file defines the `JiraClient` class, which is used by the `JiraPlugin` to interact with Jira's API. It includes methods for making requests to various Jira API endpoints such as getting project metadata, creating issues, and searching for users. The `request` method is used to make the actual HTTP requests to the Jira API.

```python
class JiraClient(ApiClient):
    """
    The JIRA API Client, so you don't have to.
    """

    PROJECT_URL = "/rest/api/2/project"
    META_URL = "/rest/api/2/issue/createmeta"
    CREATE_URL = "/rest/api/2/issue"
    PRIORITIES_URL = "/rest/api/2/priority"
    VERSIONS_URL = "/rest/api/2/project/{}/versions"
    USERS_URL = "/rest/api/2/user/assignable/search"
    ISSUE_URL = "/rest/api/2/issue/{}"
    SEARCH_URL = "/rest/api/2/search/"
    COMMENT_URL = "/rest/api/2/issue/{}/comment"
    HTTP_TIMEOUT = 5
    plugin_name = "jira"

    def __init__(self, instance_uri, username, password):
        self.base_url = instance_uri.rstrip("/")
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
```
