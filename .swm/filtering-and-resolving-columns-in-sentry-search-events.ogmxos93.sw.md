title: Filtering and Resolving Columns in Sentry Search Events
---
This document will cover the process of filtering and resolving columns in the Sentry search events, which includes:

1. Converting the default filter
2. Resolving the column name
3. Resolving the column
4. Resolving the function or field

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `release_filter_converter`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/search/events/datasets
  _release_filter_converter:::rootsStyle --> release_filter_converter:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events/datasets
  _release_filter_converter:::rootsStyle --> release_filter_converter:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events/datasets
  _release_filter_converter:::rootsStyle --> release_filter_converter:::mainFlowStyle
end

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  release_filter_converter:::mainFlowStyle --> _default_filter_converter
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  _default_filter_converter:::mainFlowStyle --> column
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  column:::mainFlowStyle --> resolve_column_name
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  resolve_column_name:::mainFlowStyle --> resolve_column
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  resolve_column:::mainFlowStyle --> resolve_function
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  resolve_column:::mainFlowStyle --> resolve_field
end
subgraph src/sentry/search/events
  resolve_field:::mainFlowStyle --> aliased_column
end
  aliased_column:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

# Converting the Default Filter

The function `_default_filter_converter` is used to convert the search filter into a condition that can be used in a SQL WHERE clause. It first resolves the column name, then checks if it's in the array fields. Depending on the operator and value of the search filter, it constructs the appropriate condition.

```python
    def _default_filter_converter(self, search_filter: SearchFilter) -> Optional[WhereType]:
        name = search_filter.key.name
        operator = search_filter.operator
        value = search_filter.value.value

        lhs = self.resolve_column(name)

        if name in ARRAY_FIELDS:
            if search_filter.value.is_wildcard():
                # TODO: There are rare cases where this chaining don't
                # work. For example, a wildcard like '\**' will incorrectly
                # be replaced with '\%%'.
                return Condition(
                    lhs,
                    Op.LIKE if operator == "=" else Op.NOT_LIKE,
                    # Slashes have to be double escaped so they are
                    # interpreted as a string literal.
                    search_filter.value.raw_value.replace("\\", "\\\\")
                    .replace("%", "\\%")
                    .replace("_", "\\_")
                    .replace("*", "%"),
```

# Resolving the Column Name

The function `resolve_column_name` is used to resolve the column name. It uses the `resolve_column` function from the utils/snuba.py file to get the actual column name in the database.

```python
    def resolve_column_name(self, col: str) -> str:
        # TODO when utils/snuba.py becomes typed don't need this extra annotation
        column_resolver: Callable[[str], str] = resolve_column(self.dataset)
        return column_resolver(col)
```

# Resolving the Column

The function `resolve_column` is used to resolve the column. It checks if the field is a function, a field alias, or a field, and calls the corresponding resolver.

```python
    def resolve_column(self, field: str, alias: bool = False) -> SelectType:
        """Given a public field, construct the corresponding Snql, this
        function will determine the type of the field alias, whether its a
        column, field alias or function and call the corresponding resolver

        :param field: The public field string to resolve into Snql. This may
                      be a column, field alias, or even a function.
        :param alias: Whether or not the resolved column is aliased to the
                      original name. If false, it may still have an alias
                      but is not guaranteed.
        """
        match = is_function(field)
        if match:
            return self.resolve_function(field, match)
        elif self.is_field_alias(field):
            return self.resolve_field_alias(field)
        else:
            return self.resolve_field(field, alias=alias)
```

# Resolving the Function or Field

The function `resolve_function` is used to resolve the function. It parses the function, checks if it's accessible, formats the arguments, and then resolves the SnQL function.

```python
    def resolve_function(
        self,
        function: str,
        match: Optional[Match[str]] = None,
        resolve_only: bool = False,
        overwrite_alias: Optional[str] = None,
    ) -> SelectType:
        """Given a public function, resolve to the corresponding Snql function


        :param function: the public alias for a function eg. "p50(transaction.duration)"
        :param match: the Match so we don't have to run the regex twice
        :param resolve_only: whether we should add the aggregate to self.aggregates
        :param overwrite_alias: ignore the alias in the parsed_function and use this string instead
        """
        if match is None:
            match = is_function(function)

        if not match:
            raise InvalidSearchQuery(f"Invalid characters in field {function}")

```
