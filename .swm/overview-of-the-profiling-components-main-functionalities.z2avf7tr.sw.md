# Structure of the Profiling Component

The Profiling component is defined in the `jsSelfProfiling.d.ts` file. It includes several types and an interface. The types include `Marker`, `Sample`, `Stack`, `Frame`, `Trace`, and `BufferFullCallback`. The interface `Profiler` includes properties such as `sampleInterval`, `stopped`, `new`, `addEventListener`, and `stop`.

```typescript
// Type definitions for https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/
declare namespace JSSelfProfiling {
  type Marker = 'script' | 'gc' | 'style' | 'layout' | 'paint' | 'other';

  type Sample = {
    timestamp: number;
    stackId?: number;
    marker?: Marker;
  };

  type Stack = {
    frameId: number;
    parentId?: number;
  };

  type Frame = {
    name: string;
    resourceId?: number;
    line?: number;
