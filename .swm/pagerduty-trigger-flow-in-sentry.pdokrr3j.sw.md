title: PagerDuty Trigger Flow in Sentry
---
This document will cover the process of sending a trigger to PagerDuty and processing the response in the Sentry application. The process includes the following steps:

1. Sending the trigger to PagerDuty
2. Posting the response
3. Previewing the response
4. Changing the account, organization, and project based on the response
5. Converting the project and organization data from JSON.

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `send_trigger`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/pagerduty
  send_incident_alert_notification:::rootsStyle --> send_trigger:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/pagerduty
  after:::rootsStyle --> send_trigger:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/pagerduty
  send_notification:::rootsStyle --> send_trigger:::mainFlowStyle
end

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  send_trigger:::mainFlowStyle --> post
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  post:::mainFlowStyle --> on_preview
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  on_preview:::mainFlowStyle --> on_account_change
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  on_account_change:::mainFlowStyle --> on_organization_change
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  on_organization_change:::mainFlowStyle --> on_project_change
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  on_project_change:::mainFlowStyle --> project_from_json
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations
  project_from_json:::mainFlowStyle --> organization_from_json
end
  organization_from_json:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

# Sending the trigger to PagerDuty

The `send_trigger` function in the `client.py` file is the starting point of the flow. It is responsible for sending a trigger to PagerDuty.

```python
from sentry.api.serializers import ExternalEventSerializer, serialize
from sentry.eventstore.models import Event
from sentry.integrations.client import ApiClient

LEVEL_SEVERITY_MAP = {
    "debug": "info",
    "info": "info",
    "warning": "warning",
    "error": "error",
    "fatal": "critical",
```

# Posting the response

The `post` function receives the response from PagerDuty. It validates the response and logs any errors. Depending on the event type in the response, it calls the appropriate function.

```python
    def post(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        signature = request.META.get("HTTP_X_SIGNATURE_HMAC_SHA256_HEX")
        variant = request.META.get("HTTP_X_SIGNATURE_KEY_VARIANT")
        logging_data = {
            "user_id": request.user.id if request.user.is_authenticated else None,
            "signature": signature,
            "variant": variant,
        }

        payload = request.body
        try:
            data = request.data
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            logger.error("cloudflare.webhook.invalid-json", extra=logging_data)
            return Response(status=400)

        event = data.get("event")
        logger.info(f"cloudflare.webhook.{event}", extra=logging_data)
        if not signature:
            logger.error("cloudflare.webhook.invalid-signature", extra=logging_data)
            return Response(status=400)
```

# Previewing the response

The `on_preview` function is called when the event type in the response is 'preview'. It checks if the user is authenticated and then calls the `on_account_change` function.

```python
    def on_preview(self, request: Request, data, is_test):
        if not request.user.is_authenticated:
            return Response({"install": data["install"], "proceed": True})

        return self.on_account_change(request, data, is_test)
```

# Changing the account, organization, and project based on the response

The `on_account_change`, `on_organization_change`, and `on_project_change` functions are called sequentially. They update the account, organization, and project based on the response data.

```python
    def on_account_change(self, request: Request, data, is_test):
        organizations = sorted(
            Organization.objects.get_for_user(request.user, scope="project:write"),
            key=lambda x: x.slug,
        )

        enum_choices = [str(o.id) for o in organizations]

        data["install"]["schema"]["properties"]["organization"] = {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Sentry Organization",
            "order": 1,
            "enum": enum_choices,
            "enumNames": {str(o.id): o.slug for o in organizations},
            "required": True,
        }
        if not enum_choices:
            return self.on_organization_clear(request, data, is_test)

        if data["install"]["options"].get("organization") not in enum_choices:
            data["install"]["options"]["organization"] = enum_choices[0]
```

# Converting the project and organization data from JSON

The `organization_from_json` and `project_from_json` functions convert the organization and project data from JSON format. They are used in the `on_organization_change` and `on_project_change` functions respectively.

```python
    def organization_from_json(self, request: Request, data, scope="project:write"):
        try:
            organization_id = data["install"]["options"]["organization"]
        except KeyError:
            return None

        organizations = Organization.objects.get_for_user(request.user, scope=scope)
        for org in organizations:
            if str(org.id) == organization_id:
                return org
        return None

    def project_from_json(self, request: Request, data, scope="project:write"):
        try:
            project_id = data["install"]["options"]["project"]
        except KeyError:
            return None

        org = self.organization_from_json(request, data)

        projects = Project.objects.filter(
