# The FreightPlugin Class

The `FreightPlugin` class is a key component of the Freight plugin. It inherits from the `ReleaseTrackingPlugin` class and contains properties such as `author`, `author_url`, `title`, `slug`, `description`, and `version`. The `get_release_hook` method returns the `FreightReleaseHook` class.

```python
class FreightPlugin(ReleaseTrackingPlugin):
    author = "Sentry Team"
    author_url = "https://github.com/getsentry"

    title = "Freight"
    slug = "freight"
    description = "Integrate Freight release tracking."
    version = sentry.VERSION

    def has_plugin_conf(self):
        return True

    def get_release_doc_html(self, hook_url):
        return DOC_HTML.format(hook_url=hook_url)

    def get_release_hook(self):
        return FreightReleaseHook
```

# The FreightReleaseHook Class

The `FreightReleaseHook` class is another key component of the Freight plugin. It inherits from the `ReleaseHook` class and overrides the `handle` method. This method processes the request based on the event type (`started` or `finished`).

```python
class FreightReleaseHook(ReleaseHook):
    def handle(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        if data["event"] == "started":
            self.start_release(version=data["sha"], ref=data["ref"], url=data["link"])
        elif data["event"] == "finished":
            self.finish_release(version=data["sha"], ref=data["ref"], url=data["link"])
        else:
            raise ValueError(data["event"])
```

# Integration of the Freight Plugin

The `FreightPlugin` is integrated into the project in the `setup.py` file. It is registered under the key `freight`.

```python
            "freight = sentry_plugins.freight.plugin:FreightPlugin",
```
