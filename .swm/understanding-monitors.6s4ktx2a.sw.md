title: Understanding Monitors
---
In the context of the demo-sentry repo, 'Monitors' is a class defined in the `static/app/views/monitors/monitors.tsx` file. It extends the `AsyncView` class and is responsible for rendering the Monitors page in the application. This page displays a list of monitors, which are essentially automated checks that Sentry performs on your system. The Monitors class fetches the list of monitors from the server, handles search queries, and renders the list of monitors along with their status and other details. The Monitors class is used in various other files in the repo, indicating that the Monitors page is accessible from different parts of the application.

# Monitor API Endpoints

The `handleDelete` function makes a DELETE request to the `/monitors/${monitor.id}/` endpoint. This endpoint is used to delete a specific monitor identified by its ID.

```tsx
    api
      .requestPromise(`/monitors/${monitor.id}/`, {
        method: 'DELETE',
      })
      .then(() => {
        browserHistory.push(redirectPath);
      })
      .catch(() => {
        addErrorMessage(t('Unable to remove monitor.'));
      });
```

The `updateMonitor` function makes a PUT request to the `/monitors/${monitor.id}/` endpoint. This endpoint is used to update a specific monitor's data.

```tsx
    api
      .requestPromise(`/monitors/${monitor.id}/`, {
        method: 'PUT',
        data,
      })
      .then(resp => {
        clearIndicators();
        onUpdate?.(resp);
      })
      .catch(err => {
        logException(err);
        addErrorMessage(t('Unable to update monitor.'));
      });
```

    endpoint={`/organizations/${orgId}/issues/`}
    query={{
      query: 'monitor.id:"' + monitor.id + '"',
