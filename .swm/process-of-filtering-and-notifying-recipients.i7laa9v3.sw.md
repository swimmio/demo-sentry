title: Process of Filtering and Notifying Recipients
---
This document will cover the process of filtering and notifying recipients in the Sentry application. The process includes the following steps:

1. Filtering recipients who have opted into notifications.
2. Determining where each recipient should be notified.
3. Getting the setting mapping from the recipient's notification settings.
4. Getting the default value by the provider from the notification settings.
5. Getting the notification setting default.

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `filter_to_accepting_recipients`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram: (Note - these are only some of the entry points of this flow)

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  send:::rootsStyle --> get_participants
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/utils
  get_participants --> get_send_to
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/utils
  get_send_to --> get_recipients_by_provider
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/manager.py
  get_recipients_by_provider --> filter_to_accepting_recipients:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/utils
  send:::rootsStyle --> send_activity_notification
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  send_activity_notification --> get_participants_with_group_subscription_reason
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  get_participants_with_group_subscription_reason --> get_participants
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/manager.py
  get_participants --> filter_to_accepting_recipients:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/utils
  send:::rootsStyle --> send_activity_notification
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  _send_notification:::rootsStyle --> send
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  send --> get_participants
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications/notifications
  get_participants_for_group:::rootsStyle --> get_participants
end

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/notifications
  filter_to_accepting_recipients:::mainFlowStyle --> where_should_recipient_be_notified
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications
  where_should_recipient_be_notified:::mainFlowStyle --> _get_setting_mapping_from_mapping
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications
  _get_setting_mapping_from_mapping:::mainFlowStyle --> _get_default_value_by_provider
end
subgraph src/sentry/notifications
  _get_default_value_by_provider:::mainFlowStyle --> _get_notification_setting_default
end
  _get_notification_setting_default:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4

# Filtering recipients who have opted into notifications

The function `filter_to_accepting_recipients` is the starting point of this process. It filters out the recipients who have opted into notifications.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from collections import defaultdict
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Iterable, Mapping, MutableMapping, MutableSet, Sequence

from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models import Q, QuerySet

from sentry import analytics
from sentry.db.models.manager import BaseManager
```

# Determining where each recipient should be notified

The function `where_should_recipient_be_notified` is used to determine the list of providers where each recipient should be notified. It calls `_get_setting_mapping_from_mapping` function to get the mapping of notification settings.

```python
def where_should_recipient_be_notified(
    notification_settings_by_recipient: Mapping[
        Team | User,
        Mapping[NotificationScopeType, Mapping[ExternalProviders, NotificationSettingOptionValues]],
    ],
    recipient: Team | User,
    type: NotificationSettingTypes = NotificationSettingTypes.ISSUE_ALERTS,
) -> list[ExternalProviders]:
    """
    Given a mapping of default and specific notification settings by user,
    return the list of providers after verifying the user has opted into this notification.
    """
    mapping = _get_setting_mapping_from_mapping(
        notification_settings_by_recipient,
        recipient,
        type,
    )
    return [
        provider
        for provider, value in mapping.items()
        if value == NotificationSettingOptionValues.ALWAYS
```

# Getting the setting mapping from the recipient's notification settings

The function `_get_setting_mapping_from_mapping` is used to get the mapping of notification settings for each recipient. It calls `_get_default_value_by_provider` function to get the default value by the provider.

```python
def _get_setting_mapping_from_mapping(
    notification_settings_by_recipient: Mapping[
        Team | User,
        Mapping[NotificationScopeType, Mapping[ExternalProviders, NotificationSettingOptionValues]],
    ],
    recipient: Team | User,
    type: NotificationSettingTypes,
) -> Mapping[ExternalProviders, NotificationSettingOptionValues]:
    """
    XXX(CEO): may not respect granularity of a setting for Slack a setting for
     email but we'll worry about that later since we don't have a FE for it yet.
    """
    return merge_notification_settings_up(
        _get_default_value_by_provider(type),
        *(
            notification_settings_by_recipient.get(recipient, {}).get(scope, {})
            for scope in (
                NotificationScopeType.USER,
                NotificationScopeType.TEAM,
                get_scope_type(type),
            )

# Getting the default value by the provider from the notification settings

The function `_get_default_value_by_provider` is used to get the default value by the provider from the notification settings. It calls `_get_notification_setting_default` function to get the notification setting default.

```python
def _get_default_value_by_provider(
    type: NotificationSettingTypes,
) -> Mapping[ExternalProviders, NotificationSettingOptionValues]:
    return {
        provider: _get_notification_setting_default(provider, type)
        for provider in NOTIFICATION_SETTING_DEFAULTS.keys()
    }
```

# Getting the notification setting default

The function `_get_notification_setting_default` is used to get the notification setting default for each provider. This is the final step in the process of filtering and notifying recipients.

```python
def _get_notification_setting_default(
    provider: ExternalProviders,
    type: NotificationSettingTypes,
) -> NotificationSettingOptionValues:
    """
    In order to increase engagement, we automatically opt users into receiving
    Slack notifications if they install Slack and link their identity.
    Approval notifications always default to Slack being on.
    """
    return NOTIFICATION_SETTING_DEFAULTS[provider][type]
```
