# Defining and Using Modals

The function `openRecoveryOptions` is an example of how modals are defined and used. It imports the `RecoveryOptionsModal` component and opens it with the provided options.

```tsx
export async function openRecoveryOptions(options: RecoveryModalOptions) {
  const mod = await import('sentry/components/modals/recoveryOptionsModal');
  const {default: Modal} = mod;

  openModal(deps => <Modal {...deps} {...options} />);
}
```

# Controlling Modal Appearance

The appearance of the modal is controlled by the `modalCss` property. This is passed to the `openModal` function along with the modal component and its options.

```tsx
  const mod = await import('sentry/components/modals/demoSignUp');
  const {default: Modal, modalCss} = mod;

  openModal(deps => <Modal {...deps} {...options} />, {modalCss});
}
```
