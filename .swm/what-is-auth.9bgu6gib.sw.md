title: What is Auth
---
In the context of the `demo-sentry` repository, 'Auth' refers to the authentication process that verifies the identity of users trying to access the system. The `auth` directory in `static/app/views/auth` contains several components related to this process, such as login, registration, and single sign-on forms. The `authConfig` state member is used to store configuration details for various authentication providers like GitHub, Google, and VSTS. The `hasAuthProviders` method checks if any of these providers are available. The `response` constant is used to handle responses from API requests related to authentication.

# Authentication Endpoints

The `/auth/login/` endpoint is used in the `LoginForm` component. This endpoint is hit when a user attempts to log in, with the `POST` method being used to send the user's login data to the server.

```tsx
      const response = await this.props.api.requestPromise('/auth/login/', {
        method: 'POST',
        data,
      });
```

```tsx
      const response = await api.requestPromise('/auth/register/', {
        method: 'POST',
        data,
      });
