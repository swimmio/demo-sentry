title: Handling Slack Group Actions in Sentry Integration
---
This document will cover the process of handling Slack group actions in the Sentry integration, which includes:

1. Processing the Slack request and determining the acting user
2. Handling status dialog submission
3. Handling interaction actions
4. Updating the message with the list of actions taken.

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `post`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram: (Note - these are only some of the entry points of this flow)

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  after:::rootsStyle --> post:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  send_notification:::rootsStyle --> post:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  handle:::rootsStyle --> send_slack_response
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  send_slack_response --> post:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  send_incident_alert_notification:::rootsStyle --> post:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  handle:::rootsStyle --> send_message
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  send_message --> post:::mainFlowStyle
end

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  post:::mainFlowStyle --> _handle_group_actions
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/slack
  _handle_group_actions:::mainFlowStyle --> build
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/metric_alerts.py
  build:::mainFlowStyle --> incident_attachment_info
end
  incident_attachment_info:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

# Processing the Slack request and determining the acting user

The function `_handle_group_actions` is used to process the Slack request and determine the acting user. If the user's identity is not found, a URL is built to associate the user's identity.

```python
    def _handle_group_actions(
        self,
        slack_request: SlackActionRequest,
        request: Request,
        action_list: Sequence[MessageAction],
    ) -> Response:
        group = get_group(slack_request)
        if not group:
            return self.respond(status=403)

        # Determine the acting user by Slack identity.
        try:
            identity = slack_request.get_identity()
        except IdentityProvider.DoesNotExist:
            return self.respond(status=403)

        if not identity:
            associate_url = build_linking_url(
                integration=slack_request.integration,
                slack_id=slack_request.user_id,
                channel_id=slack_request.channel_id,
```

# Handling status dialog submission

If the Slack request type is a dialog submission and contains a resolve type, a status action is created and processed. The message is then updated with the new status.

```python
        # Handle status dialog submission
        if (
            slack_request.type == "dialog_submission"
            and "resolve_type" in slack_request.data["submission"]
        ):
            # Masquerade a status action
            action = MessageAction(
                name="status",
                value=slack_request.data["submission"]["resolve_type"],
            )

            try:
                self.on_status(request, identity, group, action)
            except client.ApiError as error:
                return self.api_error(slack_request, group, identity, error, "status_dialog")

            attachment = SlackIssuesMessageBuilder(
                group, identity=identity, actions=[action]
            ).build()
            body = self.construct_reply(
                attachment, is_message=slack_request.callback_data["is_message"]
```

# Handling interaction actions

The function also handles interaction actions such as status, assign, and resolve dialog. After each action, the group is reloaded and the message is updated with the list of actions taken.

```python
        # Handle interaction actions
        for action in action_list:
            try:
                if action.name == "status":
                    self.on_status(request, identity, group, action)
                elif action.name == "assign":
                    self.on_assign(request, identity, group, action)
                elif action.name == "resolve_dialog":
                    self.open_resolve_dialog(slack_request, group)
                    defer_attachment_update = True
            except client.ApiError as error:
                return self.api_error(slack_request, group, identity, error, action.name)

        if defer_attachment_update:
            return self.respond()

        # Reload group as it may have been mutated by the action
        group = Group.objects.get(id=group.id)

        attachment = SlackIssuesMessageBuilder(
            group, identity=identity, actions=action_list
```
