title: Microsoft Teams Integration Flow in Sentry
---
This document will cover the process of handling Microsoft Teams integration in the Sentry application. The process includes:

1. Token exchange
2. Posting a request
3. Handling action submission
4. Building a group card
5. Building group actions
6. Generating action payload.

## Where is this flow used?

The flow starts with the function `get_token_data`. It is called from multiple entry points as represented in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  handle:::rootsStyle --> get_preinstall_client
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  get_preinstall_client --> get_token_data:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  build_integration:::rootsStyle --> get_token_data:::mainFlowStyle
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  access_token:::rootsStyle --> get_token_data:::mainFlowStyle
end

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

## The flow itself

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  get_token_data:::mainFlowStyle --> exchange_token
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  exchange_token:::mainFlowStyle --> post
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  post:::mainFlowStyle --> handle_action_submitted
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  handle_action_submitted:::mainFlowStyle --> build_group_card
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  build_group_card:::mainFlowStyle --> build_group_actions
end
subgraph src/sentry/integrations/msteams
  build_group_actions:::mainFlowStyle --> generate_action_payload
end
  generate_action_payload:::mainFlowStyle --> ...

 classDef mainFlowStyle color:#000000,fill:#7CB9F4
  classDef rootsStyle color:#000000,fill:#00FFF4
```

# Token Exchange

The `exchange_token` function is used to exchange a token with Microsoft Teams. It prepares the necessary headers and data, then makes a POST request to the Microsoft Teams token URL.

```python
    def exchange_token(self):
        headers = {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
        data = {
            "client_id": self.client_id,
            "client_secret": self.client_secret,
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "scope": "https://api.botframework.com/.default",
        }
        return self.post(self.TOKEN_URL, data=urlencode(data), headers=headers, json=False)
```

# Posting a Request

The `post` function handles the incoming POST request. It verifies the signature of the request, extracts the data, and based on the type of the message, it either handles an action submission or a conversation update.

```python
    def post(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        # verify_signature will raise the exception corresponding to the error
        verify_signature(request)

        data = request.data
        conversation_type = data.get("conversation", {}).get("conversationType")

        # only care about conversationUpdate and message
        if data["type"] == "message":
            # the only message events we care about are those which
            # are from a user submitting an option on a card, which
            # will always contain an "payload.actionType" in the data.
            if data.get("value", {}).get("payload", {}).get("actionType"):
                return self.handle_action_submitted(request)
            elif conversation_type == "channel":
                return self.handle_channel_message(request)
            else:
                return self.handle_personal_message(request)
        elif data["type"] == "conversationUpdate":
            channel_data = data["channelData"]
            event = channel_data.get("eventType")
```

# Handling Action Submission

The `handle_action_submitted` function handles the action submitted from the Microsoft Teams card. It extracts the necessary data from the request, validates the integration and group, and updates the state of the issue. Finally, it refreshes the group data and updates the card.

```python
    def handle_action_submitted(self, request: Request):
        # pull out parameters
        data = request.data
        channel_data = data["channelData"]
        tenant_id = channel_data["tenant"]["id"]
        payload = data["value"]["payload"]
        group_id = payload["groupId"]
        integration_id = payload["integrationId"]
        user_id = data["from"]["id"]
        activity_id = data["replyToId"]
        conversation = data["conversation"]
        if conversation["conversationType"] == "personal":
            conversation_id = conversation["id"]
        else:
            conversation_id = channel_data["channel"]["id"]

        try:
            integration = Integration.objects.get(id=integration_id)
        except Integration.DoesNotExist:
            logger.info(
                "msteams.action.missing-integration", extra={"integration_id": integration_id}
```

# Building a Group Card

The `build_group_card` function builds a card for a group. It prepares the title, description, footer, and assignee note of the card. It also builds the group actions and combines all these elements into a card.

```python
def build_group_card(group, event, rules, integration):
    project = Project.objects.get_from_cache(id=group.project_id)

    title = build_group_title(group)
    body = [title]

    desc = build_group_descr(group)
    if desc:
        body.append(desc)

    footer = build_group_footer(group, rules, project, event)
    body.append(footer)

    assignee_note = build_assignee_note(group)
    if assignee_note:
        body.append(assignee_note)

    actions = build_group_actions(group, event, rules, integration)
    body.append(actions)

    return {
```

# Building Group Actions

The `build_group_actions` function builds the actions for a group. Depending on the status of the group, it prepares the resolve, ignore, and assign actions. These actions are then combined into a container.

```python
def build_group_actions(group, event, rules, integration):
    status = group.get_status()

    if status == GroupStatus.RESOLVED:
        resolve_action = {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Unresolve",
            "data": generate_action_payload(ACTION_TYPE.UNRESOLVE, event, rules, integration),
        }
    else:
        resolve_action = {
            "type": "Action.ShowCard",
            "version": "1.2",
            "title": "Resolve",
            "card": {
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "body": [
                    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Resolve", "weight": "Bolder"},
                    {
                        "type": "Input.ChoiceSet",
                        "id": "resolveInput",
```

# Generating Action Payload

The `generate_action_payload` function generates the payload for an action. It takes the action type, event, rules, and integration as parameters and returns a payload object.

```python
def generate_action_payload(action_type, event, rules, integration):
    rule_ids = map(lambda x: x.id, rules)
    # we need nested data or else Teams won't handle the payload correctly
    return {
        "payload": {
            "actionType": action_type,
            "groupId": event.group.id,
            "eventId": event.event_id,
            "rules": rule_ids,
            "integrationId": integration.id,
        }
    }
```
