# Structure and Functionality of the Profiling Component

The Profiling component is defined in this file. It includes properties such as `endValue`, `startValue`, `name`, `unit`, `weights`, `samples`, and `type`. These properties are used to store and manage profiling data.

```typescript
declare namespace Profiling {
  interface RawProfileBase {
    endValue: number;
    startValue: number;
    name: string;
    unit: string;
    spans?: Span[];
  }

  // Android traces follow this format
  interface EventedProfile extends RawProfileBase {
    events: ReadonlyArray<Event>;
    type: 'evented';
  }

  // iOS traces follow this format
  interface SampledProfile extends RawProfileBase {
    weights: number[];
    samples: number[][];
    type: 'sampled';
  }
```

# Interaction of the Profiling Component with Other Components

The Profiling component interacts with other components through the `ProfilingTableProps` interface. This interface includes properties such as `error`, `isLoading`, `location`, and `traces`, which are used to manage the state and behavior of the Profiling component.

```tsx
interface ProfilingTableProps {
  error: string | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  location: Location;
  traces: Trace[];
}
```
